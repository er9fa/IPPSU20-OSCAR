        Hi everyone! My name is Katie, I am a rising third year from
        Charlottesville, Virginia. My parents were in the Navy, so I was born in
        Agana, Guam, and moved around a bit before settling down in
        Charlottesville. I went to Charlottesville High School but spent my junior
        year of high school studying abroad in Beijing, China. I am in the School
        of Commerce, but double majoring in computer science. I joined the
        computer science major rather late, so I am excited to learn more this
        summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for hobbies, I really enjoy hiking and photography. I enjoy running
        and exploring new places, which can be hard to do at UVA since I have
        lived in Charlottesville for a while. I also really enjoy learning new
        things and researching obscure topics when I’m bored.
      </p>

  	    I would say one of my strengths is that I am detail oriented. At the same
        time, focusing on the small details can often be time-consuming, so I try
        to step back and look at the bigger picture. Another one of my strengths
        is that I am organized. I think that staying organized makes work much
        easier and more productive. My biggest weakness is that I have trouble
        asking for help. I want to be efficient in my own work, but I’ve also
        realized that asking for help is often the more efficient alternative.
        Another one of my weaknesses is that I am easily distracted. At the same
        time, I can assess when a task needs to be done. I’m excited to be working
        with you all this summer!
