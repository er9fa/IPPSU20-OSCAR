    My name is Renita and I’m from Midlothian, VA. I moved to America from India when I was 7 years old and lived here ever since. I jumped around majors because I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do coming into college. I actually started out in the School of Architecture. I eventually ended up declaring majors in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a minor in Psychology. I’m really excited to be part of this internship because I’ve been eager to gain experience outside of the classroom.
    <br>I love playing sports so whenever I get the chance I try to get out and play. I used to play tennis in high school and I just recently started playing with some friends at college. Now I play tennis with my brother at home. I also love badminton, basketball, and throwing the football around. I also enjoy doing art and I’ve been trying to get back into it this summer. I also love learning languages so  I’m currently taking Korean in college and while at home I’m trying to learn how to read and write Tamil.
    <br>Some of my strengths include organization, task prioritization, and using my creativity to analyze problems and generate solutions. When I’m passionate and excited about what I’m doing, I always try my best to do a really good job. If I’m unable to figure something out quickly I do tend to stress out and it makes it harder for me to keep going. However, I’m getting more comfortable with asking questions so that I do learn from my mistakes.
